# Scientific Model made with node.js and csv-parse to map how many habitable exoplanets exist according to data provided by the NASA Exoplanet Archive.

# WHAT MADE POSSIBLE THIS MODEL

All the information provided by the NASA Exoplanet Archive related to the Kepler Telescope was used and mapped according to properties set by specialists.

The next values that indicates if a planet is habitable where applied to this model:

- The planet needs to be confirmed ü¶ï(not to be a candidate or false positive)
- Stellar Flux must to be between 0.36 and 1.11 üåû(how much solar light the planet receives compared to the Earth)
- The planeraty radius of the planet needs to be no more than 1.6 times the radius of the earth üåç(otherwise we would have mini-neptunes, planets composed mainly with gases).

# This model found that amongst more than 9500 discovered exoplantes, 8 of then are habitable.

The planets are: Kepler-1652 b, Kepler-1410 b, Kepler-296 f, Kepler-442 b, Kepler-296 e, Kepler-1649 b, Kepler-62 f, Kepler-452 b.
